// The Crucible, American English

@20000 = ~Something feels wrong, and I do not feel I should have left my pocket plane in this desolate landscape. My blood beckons me to move north, but I do not know the dangers that await me.~
@20001 = ~I have reached the entryway into Bhaal's realm, but it appears to be warded and I was attacked. I will have to search for a way to bypass the warding.~
@20002 = ~This Medallion of Bhaal allowed me to bypass the warding, so I may now enter into Bhaal's realm.~
@20003 = ~I encountered Mayithra, a servant of Amelyssan. Her skirmishers have set themselves to stall me while she moves forward to seal off my progress. I must hurry to prevent this from happening.~
@20004 = ~Mayithra may be dead, but she was successful in blocking my advance. I must explore the towers on both sides of me to see if I can find a way into Bhaal's kingdom.~
@20005 = ~I learned Amelyssan staged a coup and not all of Bhaal's followers were behind her in her decision to wrest control and become a god herself. It appears many of those faithful to Bhaal were slain. It's possible some remain who can aid me against Amelyssan.~
@20006 = ~At the base of the tower I confronted the demon Sapphira who had interesting things to say of Bhaal and how he started his road to becoming a deity. Supposedly before confronting Jergal, the Dark Three defeated and consumed the divinity from those known as the Seven Lost Gods. If Sapphira is to believed, one of these gods is the master of this tower.~
